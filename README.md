# Touch√©
Touch to mouse event mapping for testing touch interfaces with desktop browsers.

Inspired by Phantom Limb (https://github.com/brian-c/phantom-limb), but seeking less bloat (no graphics) and more conformance to actual touch objects (test with http://frontendstuff.com/javascript/examples/touch.html), and much more minimal code.
